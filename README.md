# Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph Server (CVE-2024–27348)

[CVE-2024-27348](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27348) is a critical Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache HugeGraph Server, a popular graph database system. The flaw resides in the Gremlin traversal language interface, which allows users to interact with the graph database. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the Gremlin server, potentially gaining the ability to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the underlying system.

To mitigate this risk, the Apache Software Foundation recommends users to upgrade to HugeGraph version 1.3.0 or later and ensure it runs on Java 11. Additionally, implementing the built-in authentication system and configuring the "Whitelist-IP/port" function can help restrict access and improve security​.
